In the list of eleven things people regularly do illegally on the internet without knowing, it is very clear which crimes are the most deviant and which are hardly serious at all. First, collecting information about children is arguably the most severe, as any crime that corrupts and exploits the innocence of youth violates various laws that can facilitate heinous crimes like grooming or child exploitation. Next, the sharing of passwords, addresses, and photos of others is a profound invasion of privacy, as doxing leads to real‑world harm like identity theft or physical danger. Third, bullying and trolling goes beyond simple internet mischief and enters the legal category of targeted harassment. Cyberbullying can lead to profound and lasting psychological damage, especially with young people. Fourth, faking your identity online is a threat as it's an offense that can lead to fraud and financial scams that deceive others for malicious purposes. Finally, illegal searches on the internet are incredibly serious as it implies the intent to search for content related to child exploitation, terrorism, drug trafficking, illegal weapons sales, human trafficking, and explosive device manufacturing. These behaviors show intent to cause profound societal harm and therefore must be categorized as one of the most severe offenses.
